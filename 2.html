<h2>CSS</h2>
This Page is about CSS.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]

<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

<p>A popular Korean folktale is the story of "**The Woodcutter and the Fairy**," where a woodcutter spies a group of fairies bathing in a pond and steals one of their cloaks to prevent her from returning to the heavens, eventually marrying her and having children. However, when she discovers her hidden cloak, she returns to the sky, leaving the woodcutter heartbroken.</p>
