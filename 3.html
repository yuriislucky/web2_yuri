<h2>Java Script</h2>
<p>This page is about JavaScript.avaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, dynamic programming language that is primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic content to websites. It's a core technology of the World Wide Web, allowing developers to create interactive user experiences and perform various tasks on web pages. Essentially, it's the "scripting" language that makes websites come alive with features like animations, form validation, and dynamic updates. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Core Technology of the Web:
JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
Interactivity and Dynamic Content:
JavaScript allows websites to respond to user actions (like clicks or form submissions) and update the content on the page without needing to reload the entire page. 
Client-Side Execution:
JavaScript code typically runs directly in the user's web browser (client-side), which allows for faster response times and a smoother user experience.</p>

<p>A popular Korean folktale is the story of "**The Woodcutter and the Fairy**," where a woodcutter spies a group of fairies bathing in a pond and steals one of their cloaks to prevent her from returning to the heavens, eventually marrying her and having children. However, when she discovers her hidden cloak, she returns to the sky, leaving the woodcutter heartbroken.</p>
